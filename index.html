                    AquaMarine is a virtual fishing and aquarium application I created in May 2021 to help
                    me learn Python. Since its public debut in August 2021, it has gained increasing popularity
                    with over 350 downloads, 900 users, and 100k commands ran. Then in June 2023 I started reworking
                    the bot, fully updating the code and remaking it. Now it is fully functional with over a hundred 
                    different fish and something for everyone.

                AP Computer Science A Learning Objectives:
            </h1>
            <h2>• How can objects and classes make problem solving easier and more efficient? </h2>
            <p>
                Objects and classes are useful due to their ability to save the amount of code you write and the
                size of your files. Being able to compress many different types of data into one object lets you 
                not have to worry about keeping track of a lot of variable names and lets you go through problem 
                solving much faster and more efficient. 
            </p>
            <h2>• How can a programmer use simulations to solve real-world problems?</h2>
            <p>
                A programmer can use simulations to solve real-world problems in experiments that when done in the 
                real world would be either too expensive or too harmful to do. This could be simulating what a 
                certain drug does to pregnant women or finding out what would have happened if people with their 
                current mindsets went back to try to survive in ages before technological advances.
            </p>
            <h2>• What is the advantages of using arrays and array lists?  </h2>
            <p> 
                One advantage is the ability to have immense amounts of data stored in an iterable letting you not have 
                to worry about defining however many variables and keep track of all their different names. 
            </p>
            <h2>• What roles do member functions, private data members, and constructors play in a program containing classes?</h2>
            <p>
                Member functions let an object manipulate given data to it or manipulate its own stored data, 
                performing many actions on the object. Private data members are the private data that is stored 
                in the class and used to store various data that is unique to each object, that can't be accessed 
                outside the object except by a member function. Constructors are used to create the object and 
                normally set the private variables to their approriate state based on passed in variables.
            </p>
            <h2>• What impact does inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes play in computer programming? </h2>
            <p>
                Inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes all have the impact of letting programmers sort 
                and organze data with simple differences and similar aspects in ways that give the most freedom 
                to the programmer.
