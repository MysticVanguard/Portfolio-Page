                    <p>
                        AquaMarine is a virtual fishing and aquarium application I created in May 2021 to help
                        me learn Python. Since its public debut in August 2021, it has gained increasing popularity
                        with over 350 servers, 900 users, and 100k commands ran. The bot has over 100 unique pixel
                        fish to catch, all levelable and    .
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is by far the best project I have made due to it's success, what I've learned from it, and
                        how much I have enjoyed making it. The idea of Aqua first came from a friend, who had made a
                        similar bot that let you take care of plants in a virtual garden called
                        <a class="shown" href="https://github.com/Voxel-Fox-Ltd/Flower">Flower</a>. With a bit of help
                        in the beginning I was able to learn the discord python library's documentation and syntax, and
                        could start making my bot. It started out with only 10 fish and only the fishing command,
                        letting
                        you randomly catch one of the fish. As I continued I created an economy and different rarities
                        for
                        the fish, adding more and more fish and commands for users to interact with.

                    <h2>Garbage Gurus</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        Garbage Gurus is a website I created with a group of friends for Pine Richland High School's
                        2023 Hack The Ram competition (found <a class="shown" href="https://hacktheram.com/">here</a>),
                        where we had roughly
                        8 hours to create an application that addressed the competitions topic "code.change". Our idea
                        was the creation of a website that lets you take a picture of a piece of trash and have a
                        machine learning model decide if it was recyclable and what type of recyclable it was, and then
                        based on the type of recyclable it was the website would direct the user to information on
                        recyling that type of object. I was responsible for creating most of the website and did most
                        of the front end development of the project. We had gotten the website working nice and well and
                        our machine learning model trained and working, but unfortunately with the time restraint we
                        were unable to get the api to link the two to make the picture upload have functionality.
                        Through this project I was able to understand to a deeper level what it took to work on a team
                        and do my part of a bigger project.

                        Housing Homies is a website I built for the 2024 Bitcamp hackathon at UMD. We took on 
                        <a class="shown" href="https://www.fanniemae.com/">Fannie Mae</a>'s challenge at the hackathon
                        where we looked into the data for where weather and housing information come together, as well 
                        as how natural disasters impact low income housing areas. We used ArcGISt to create maps and embed
                        them in the website, as well as various JavaScript scripts to format data for web pages for each county.

                        GameJam. The theme of the jam was "It's Spreading," and we choose to use this theme with the idea 
                        that you can counteract the spread of depression by spreading happiness.
