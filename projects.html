            <h2><a class="shown" href="http://www.ramhack.com/">Garbage Gurus</a></h2>
            <p>Garbage Gurus is a website I created with a group of friends for Pine Richland High School's 
               2023 Hack The Ram competition (found <a class="shown" href="https://hacktheram.com/">here</a>), where we had roughly 
               8 hours to create an application that addressed the competitions topic "code.change". Our idea 
               was the creation of a website that lets you take a picture of a piece of trash and have a 
               machine learning model decide if it was recyclable and what type of recyclable it was, and then 
               based on the type of recyclable it was the website would direct the user to information on 
               recyling that type of object. I was responsible for creating most of the website and did most 
               of the front end development of the project. We had gotten the website working nice and well and 
               our machine learning model trained and working, but unfortunately with the time restraint we 
               were unable to get the api to link the two to make the picture upload have functionality.</p>
