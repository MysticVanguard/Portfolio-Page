                    <p>
                        The first project I ever worked on in my computer science career is the
                        bot I created called <a class="shown" href="projects.html#AquaMarine">AquaMarine</a>
                        <a class="shown" href="https://github.com/MysticVanguard/AquaMarine/blob/4e1031bde8c2726b830d5c800963c1952af75e04/AquaMarine.py">
                        (The first version of the code looking like this)</a>. 
                        I had learned the very basics of Python using a CodeCademy Course and had multiple
                        friends who knew Python and created bots, so I used Aqua to put my knowledge to the
                        test and learn the intermediate skills when coding in Python. The bot's first version
                        was created over the 2021 summer and was ready to leave testing and be public by August,
                        where it quickly grew to hit the 100 server mark in February of 2022. Since then it became
                        verified and sits at over 350 servers one year later, February of 2023, and has had 19
                        major updates to the code.

                        My latest project has been my adventures in web design, and include 
                        <a class="shown" href="https://github.com/MysticVanguard/Portfolio-Page">this website</a> and

                        AquaMarine's website</a>. I started my learning in November of 2022, and as of writing this
                        it is currently February of 2023 and I have put a total of 21 hours towards learning how
                        to write code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as 6 hours towards creating this
                        website.

                        Overall my knowledge the past two years has grown drastically, from going to knowing
                        absolutely no code to learning Python, PostgreSQL, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
                        I will hopefully continue my pursuit in these teaching so that I can learn more advanced
                        computer science ideas and skills, and I will be updating this section either yearly or
                        bi-yearly to track my most recent projects.

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>
                        My experience in research involves most of my teachings in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                        as I am self taught past the beginner level. My research goes mostly in depth within the Python
                        library "Novus" as it is the main library I used to create my application. I also became familiar
                        with Python libraries such as Aiohttp and Asyncio, as well as splitting code into cogs. I also 
                        taught myself how to navigate Linux and use databases such as PostgreSQL. My experience with all 
                        of this has been very good, as it has led me to being able to create the things I want to do with 
                        ease.
