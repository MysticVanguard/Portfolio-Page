                        The first project I ever worked on in my computer science career is the 
                        bot I created called <a class="shown" href="projects.html#AquaMarine">AquaMarine</a>. 
                        I had learned the very basics of Python using a CodeCademy Course and had multiple 
                        friends who knew Python and created bots, so I used Aqua to put my knowledge to the 
                        test and learn the intermediate skills when coding in Python. The bot's first version 
                        was created over the 2021 summer and was ready to leave testing and be public by August, 
                        where it quickly grew to hit the 100 server mark in February of 2022. Since then it became 
                        verified and sits at over 350 servers one year later, February of 2023, and has had 19 
                        major updates to the code.

                        My latest project has been my adventures in web design, and include this website and 
                        AquaMarine's website. I started my learning in November of 2022, and as of writing this 
                        it is currently February of 2023 and I have put a total of 21 hours towards learning how 
                        to write code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as 6 hours towards creating this 
                        website.

                        Overall my knowledge the past two years has grown drastically, from going to knowing 
                        absolutely no code to learning Python, PostgreSQL, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
                        I will hopefully continue my pursuit in these teaching so that I can learn more advanced 
                        computer science ideas and skills, and I will be updating this section either yearly or 
                        bi-yearly to track my most recent projects.
